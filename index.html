           <p>It feels good to be back in a queen! I've used one adjective to describe myself. What is it? Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.

           <p>Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. I've made a huge tiny mistake. You might enjoy this. Oh. Em. Gee. That's amazing. How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! Steve Holt? The moron jock? Operation Hot Mother. The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Heyyyyy campers!

           <p>Oh, like when they say "poofter" to mean "tourist", yes. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. That's the first time we were in the shower since our honeymoon. And this time, no tears. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. You must teach me the ways of the secular flesh. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job.
